Website using Code Igniter MVC Framework to control the Database and Views. The relevant SQL for a local MySQL database stored in OTR3.sql file. You'll have to download this and implement on your local machine. While the presentation of the work is nothing fancy, the real point of this exercise was to show the interaction between the site and the relevant database. Intending to improve on this over the next few weeks.
